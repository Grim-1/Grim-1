👋 Hi there! I'm a passionate **Electronics and Communication Engineering student** in my final year, exploring the intersection of hardware and software with a knack for innovation.  

💡 I thrive on creating intelligent, practical, and sometimes quirky solutions. From building **AI-powered home automation systems** like *Sentinel* to crafting a *Plant Pot Bot* that mischievously avoids light, I love tackling challenges with creativity and logic.  

🔍 My journey includes working on impactful projects like a **regional language-to-Braille printer** and developing **IoT Systems**. I’m also venturing into the **Business Analytics** domain, sharpening my analytical skills for data-driven decision-making.  

🚀 As an intern and startup enthusiast, I enjoy working with multiple teams to foster creativity and problem-solving.  

🌿 When I'm not tinkering, I dream of living off-grid in a forest, building sustainable homes, farming, and caring for animals.  

Let's build something amazing together! 🌟
